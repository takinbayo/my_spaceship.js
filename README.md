## Task
We're iterating through a string that has the flightpath for a spaceship. There are only 3 valid options: right, left, 
and advance. My job is to return the coordinates of that spaceship based on the given flighpath. 

## Description
The problem was solved by creating a variable with the 4 possible orientations. The instructions say the ship always starts by facing up.
I used if/ else statements to show when and where the spaceship will move.
